# Brain-Stroke-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Brain Stroke is a serious medical condition which occurs when the blood supply to the parts of the brain 
is cut off. This is a great cause of extensive brain injury or even death in serious cases around the world. 
There are mainly two types of brain stroke: Ischemic stroke- due to a blood clot in blood vessel, 
Hemorrhagic stroke- due to a weak blood vessel to blood and leaking into the brain. Both types of brain 
strokes are fatal and can cause extensive damage. As this is a very serious and life-threatening medical 
condition, by any means if it can be detected it could be a matter of life and death. Machine learning 
models to detect these types of serious condition could have a great impact in the medical industry along 
with peopleâ€™s lives. This research study proposes a brain stroke detection model using machine learning 
algorithms to derive some insightful information.
